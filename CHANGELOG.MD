# eCommerce-BackEnd

1. Added sequelize to code to server.js
2. Added columns to table models
3. Added Category API routes
4. Add Tag API Routes
5. Add Product API Routes
6. App doesn't run correctly when routes & models use camelCase and seeds use snake_case. Changed column names in routes & models to snake_case & app runs.
